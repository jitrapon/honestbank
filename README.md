# Android Engineering Assignment

This is a hands-on coding exercise.

The Android project contained in this folder has some issues that prevent it from functioning properly.

## Objectives

1. Fix all bugs
2. Implement the missing feature (marked as **TODO**) in the **Application Specs** section below

## Application Specs

This is a quiz application consisting of 3 screens. You are being asked to add the 4th screen:

<img src="./screenshot/screenshot_welcome_screen.png" width="280"><img src="./screenshot/screenshot_quiz_screen.png" width="280"><img src="./screenshot/screenshot_result_screen.png" width="280">

1. **Welcome Screen** - lets users enter their name then click "START". Name
   is required and the user cannot proceed without entering some text
2. **Quiz Screen** - there are 10 multiple choice questions displayed randomly.
   Users can navigate between questions before submitting the quiz for scoring
3. **Result Screen** - once the user taps "Submit" the app will take user to this
   screen and show user's total score. This screen allows navigating back to the
   Welcome Screen
4. **TODO: Scoreboard Screen** - display a list of people who have taken the quiz, their score, and
   their rank

## Optional

If time permits, or if you feel like, please feel free to improve the app in any way you'd like. Some
ideas are provided below:

1. Improve the UX/UI
1. Refactor/reorganize the app code for modularization/maintainability
